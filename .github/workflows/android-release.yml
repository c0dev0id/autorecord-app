            ## Motorcycle Voice Notes Release

            ### Installation

            Download the appropriate APK:
            - **Debug APK**: For development and testing (recommended for most users)
            - **Release APK**: Optimized production version (may be signed or unsigned)

            > **Note**: If the release APK is signed, it can be used for production. If unsigned, you may need to sign it yourself using your own keystore. See [SIGNING.md](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/blob/main/SIGNING.md) for instructions.

            ### First-Time Setup

            1. Install the APK on your Android device (enable "Install from Unknown Sources")
            2. Launch the app and grant required permissions:
               - Microphone (for audio recording)
               - Fine Location (for GPS coordinates)
               - Storage (for saving files)
            3. Configure:
               - Choose a save directory for recordings
               - Select a trigger app to launch after recording

            ### Usage

            After setup, the app will:
            1. Acquire GPS location
            2. Announce "Location acquired, recording for 10 seconds"
            3. Record audio for 10 seconds
            4. Announce "Recording stopped"
            5. Save file as: `latitude_longitude_timestamp.3gp`
            6. Launch your configured trigger app

            ### Requirements

            - Android 8.0 (API 26) or higher
            - GPS capability
            - Microphone
