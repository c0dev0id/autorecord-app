# Motorcycle Voice Notes

A lightweight Android app for motorcyclists to quickly record voice notes with GPS location tracking while riding.

## What It Does

Motorcycle Voice Notes is designed for hands-free operation while riding. When you launch the app:

1. **Speaks your GPS coordinates** via text-to-speech
2. **Captures your voice message** through speech recognition
3. **Records audio** (configurable 1-99 seconds, default 10 seconds)
4. **Saves the recording** with GPS coordinates in the filename
5. **Creates a GPX waypoint** with your transcribed message
6. **Launches your preferred app** (navigation, music, etc.)

## Key Features

- **GPS Tagging**: Every recording is named with precise coordinates and timestamp
- **Speech-to-Text**: Your spoken words become waypoint descriptions in the GPX file
- **Bluetooth Support**: Automatically uses your Bluetooth headset/helmet system
- **Customizable**: Set recording duration, storage location, and trigger app
- **GPX Export**: All locations saved to `acquired_locations.gpx` for easy import into mapping apps
- **Minimal Interaction**: Launch once, everything happens automatically
- **Overlay Bubble**: Visual feedback during recording with transcribed text display

## Perfect For

- Recording riding observations and directions
- Making quick voice memos without stopping
- Tagging interesting locations with voice notes
- Building route waypoints for future reference
- Hands-free operation with Bluetooth helmet systems
